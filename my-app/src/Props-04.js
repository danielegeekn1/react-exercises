//What happens if the `name` prop is a JSX expression instead of a string? How do you pass a prop that contains a JSX expression? Modify the value passed to the `name` prop so that it's contained within a `strong` tag.
//you can add a JS expression in JSX as props, in order to do it it's necessary to put the expressione in curley brackets as in this example below
//foo={1 + 2 + 3 + 4}
