Can you render the `Message` component directly within the `App` component? What happens if you do?

Usually the App component, is the main file they use a root file, from which all the React App will start, so you can add all your components within the App file, if you add a component to the App file, considering we're using it as main root file, it'll be rendered exactly where you declare it, in this case you can decide the order of your components, which determines the order of their rendering
